# Hand Gesture Recognition model to identify different hand gestures

## Overview

This repository contains a Python notebook that uses TensorFlow to create a hand gesture recognisation model, in which it accurately predicts the hand gestures based on the data fitted in the model

## Contents

The repository contains the following file:-

1.  task4.ipynb : A jupyter notebook including the code of the Linear Regression Model
2.  requirements.txt : A text file containing the libraries used to create this project
3.  hand_gesture.keras : This is the saved Keras model

## Getting Started :-

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required python libraries from requirments.txt
3. Open the task3.ipynb on your system and run the file or load the model hand_gesture.keras and use it to accurately predict the hand gestures

## Results :-

The performance of this model is based on the number of data it is fitted with and the amount of times it is trained according to the data. For the model to be more accurate, a huge amount of data needs to be used to train the model.

## Contributing :-

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknoledgment :-

- The dataset was obtained from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)
- This project was inspired by various online tutorials and courses on machine learning and data science.
